### Exercism

This repo is to share the code I submit on the **Exercism** platform.

Available at:Â [exercism.org](https://exercism.org/)

I am not a software developer, but as a Security Engineer I consider that writing and (as important) reading code should be something one is used to.

Because Security Engineering work is not always around code, I use this platform to keep myself active. Even simple exercises are good for this goal.

Lastly... **Go Python <3 :)**
